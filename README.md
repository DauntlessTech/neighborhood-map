1. git clone https://github.com/zafuzi/neighborhood-map

2. cd neighborhood-map

3. Open index.html in your favorite browser.

## Tips
 - Access the sidebar by clicking the blue cog in the top left corner

 - Search for a city and filter type using the search bars located in the sidebar

 - Click on any result to open the corresponding infowindow and marker

 - To show all of the markers for a search, simply repeat the search with the same query parameters

 - Bookmarks can be made by clicking the icon next to any venue, likewise removing bookmarks is as easy as clicking on their corresponding icon
